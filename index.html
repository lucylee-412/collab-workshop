        <h1>Covid versus the World</h1>
        <p>COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a disease caused by a virus
          named SARS-CoV-2 and was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.
          It is very contagious and has quickly spread around the world.</p>

        <p>COVID-19 most often causes respiratory symptoms that can feel much
          like a cold, a flu, or pneumonia. COVID-19 may attack more than your
          lungs and respiratory system. Other parts of your body may also be
          affected by the disease.</p>

        <p>COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and
          very small particles that contain the virus. These droplets and
          particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes,
          noses, or mouth. In some circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces
          they touch. People who are closer than 6 feet from the infected person
          are most likely to get infected.</p>

        <p>Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people become
          severely ill. Some people including those with minor or no symptoms
          may suffer from post-COVID conditions. Older adults and people who
          have certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk of
          severe illness from COVID-19.</p>

          <p>Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Remember that some

          <p>Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arm lengths) from other people,
            especially if you are at higher risk of getting very sick.</p>
